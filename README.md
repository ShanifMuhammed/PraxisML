# PraxisML

PraxisML is a personal project dedicated to building machine learning algorithms from the ground up using Python. The name is derived from the Greek word praxis, which means the process of turning theory into practical action. That is the core philosophy here: to solidify my understanding of machine learning by implementing algorithms from scratch.

This repository serves as a public log of my learning progress and a showcase of my ability to translate complex mathematical concepts into clean, functional Python code.

Goals
To gain a deep, fundamental understanding of how ML algorithms work internally.

To improve my Python, NumPy, and software development skills.

To build a portfolio that demonstrates a passion for machine learning fundamentals.

Disclaimer: ⚠️ This is a learning project and is not intended for production use. The implementations prioritize clarity and educational value over the computational efficiency of libraries like scikit-learn.
